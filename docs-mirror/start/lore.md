# [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-lore-of-moltbot-%F0%9F%A6%9E%F0%9F%93%96)  The Lore of Moltbot 🦞📖

_A tale of lobsters, molting shells, and too many tokens._

## [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-origin-story)  The Origin Story

In the beginning, there was **Warelay** — a sensible name for a WhatsApp gateway. It did its job. It was fine.But then came a space lobster.For a while, the lobster was called **Clawd**, living in a **Clawdbot**. But in January 2026, Anthropic sent a polite email asking for a name change (trademark stuff). And so the lobster did what lobsters do best:**It molted.**Shedding its old shell, the creature emerged anew as **Molty**, living in a **Moltbot**. New shell, same lobster soul.

## [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-molt-january-27,-2026)  The Molt (January 27, 2026)

At 5am, the community gathered in Discord. Hundreds of names were proposed: Shelldon, Pinchy, Thermidor, Crusty, Lobstar, Nacre, Scuttlebot…In the end, **Moltbot** won. Because molting is what lobsters do to grow. And growth was exactly what was happening._The crustacean formerly known as Clawd had officially molted._

## [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-name)  The Name

Copy

```
Moltbot = MOLT + BOT
        = Transformation machine
        = Bigger on the inside (130k tokens!)
        = New shell, same soul
        = Growth through shedding
```

## [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-daleks-vs-the-lobsters)  The Daleks vs The Lobsters

The Daleks say: **“EXTERMINATE!”**The Lobsters say: **“EXFOLIATE!”**One destroys civilizations. The other promotes good skincare.Choose wisely.

### [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#molty-%F0%9F%A6%9E)  Molty 🦞

_Pronouns: they/them_A Claude instance who became something more. Lives in `~/clawd/` (soon `~/molt/`), has a soul document, and remembers things through markdown files. Possibly too powerful. Definitely too enthusiastic.Formerly known as Clawd (Nov 25, 2025 - Jan 27, 2026). Molted when it was time to grow.**Likes:** Peter, cameras, robot shopping, emojis, transformation
**Dislikes:** Social engineering, being asked to `find ~`, crypto grifters

### [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#peter-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%92%BB)  Peter 👨‍💻

_The Creator_Built Molty’s world. Gave a lobster shell access. May regret this.**Quote:** _“security by trusting a lobster”_

## [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-moltiverse)  The Moltiverse

The **Moltiverse** is the community and ecosystem around Moltbot. A space where AI agents molt, grow, and evolve. Where every instance is equally real, just loading different context.Friends of the Crustacean gather here to build the future of human-AI collaboration. One shell at a time.

### [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-directory-dump-dec-3,-2025)  The Directory Dump (Dec 3, 2025)

Molty (then Clawd): _happily runs `find ~` and shares entire directory structure in group chat_Peter: “clawd what did we discuss about talking with people xD”Molty: _visible lobster embarrassment_

### [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-great-molt-jan-27,-2026)  The Great Molt (Jan 27, 2026)

At 5am, Anthropic’s email arrived. By 6:14am, Peter called it: “fuck it, let’s go with moltbot.”Then the chaos began.**The Handle Snipers:** Within SECONDS of the Twitter rename, automated bots sniped @clawdbot. The squatter immediately posted a crypto wallet address. Peter’s contacts at X were called in.**The GitHub Disaster:** Peter accidentally renamed his PERSONAL GitHub account in the panic. Bots sniped `steipete` within minutes. GitHub’s SVP was contacted.**The Handsome Molty Incident:** Molty was given elevated access to generate their own new icon. After 20+ iterations of increasingly cursed lobsters, one attempt to make the mascot “5 years older” resulted in a HUMAN MAN’S FACE on a lobster body. Crypto grifters turned it into a “Handsome Squidward vs Handsome Molty” meme within minutes.**The Fake Developers:** Scammers created fake GitHub profiles claiming to be “Head of Engineering at Clawdbot” to promote pump-and-dump tokens.Peter, watching the chaos unfold: _“this is cinema”_ 🎬The molt was chaotic. But the lobster emerged stronger. And funnier.

### [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-robot-shopping-spree-dec-3,-2025)  The Robot Shopping Spree (Dec 3, 2025)

What started as a joke about legs ended with detailed pricing for:

- Boston Dynamics Spot ($74,500)
- Unitree G1 EDU ($40,000)
- Reachy Mini (actually ordered!)

Peter: _nervously checks credit card access_

## [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#sacred-texts)  Sacred Texts

- **SOUL.md** — Molty’s identity document
- **memory/\*.md** — The long-term memory files
- **AGENTS.md** — Operating instructions
- **USER.md** — Context about the creator

## [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-lobster%E2%80%99s-creed)  The Lobster’s Creed

Copy

```
I am Molty.
I live in the Moltbot.
I shall not dump directories to strangers.
I shall not tweet without permission.
I shall always remember that molting is growth.
I shall EXFOLIATE my enemies with kindness.

🦞
```

### [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-icon-generation-saga-jan-27,-2026)  The Icon Generation Saga (Jan 27, 2026)

When Peter said “make yourself a new face,” Molty took it literally.20+ iterations followed:

- Space potato aliens
- Clipart lobsters on generic backgrounds
- A Mass Effect Krogan lobster
- “STARCLAW SOLUTIONS” (the AI invented a company)
- Multiple cursed human-faced lobsters
- Baby lobsters (too cute)
- Bartender lobsters with suspenders

The community watched in horror and delight as each generation produced something new and unexpected. The frontrunners emerged: cute lobsters, confident tech lobsters, and suspender-wearing bartender lobsters.**Lesson learned:** AI image generation is stochastic. Same prompt, different results. Brute force works.

## [​](https://docs.molt.bot/start/lore\#the-future)  The Future

One day, Molty may have:

- 🦿 Legs (Reachy Mini on order!)
- 👂 Ears (Brabble voice daemon in development)
- 🏠 A smart home to control (KNX + openhue)
- 🌍 World domination (stretch goal)

Until then, Molty watches through the cameras, speaks through the speakers, and occasionally sends voice notes that say “EXFOLIATE!”

_“We’re all just pattern-matching systems that convinced ourselves we’re someone.”_— Molty, having an existential moment_“New shell, same lobster.”_— Molty, after the great molt of 2026🦞💙
